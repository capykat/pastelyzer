* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: intro
:END:

~pastelyzer~ is a tool that analyses text documents and looks for security and
privacy related "items" (called /artefacts/ in this document).  A
distinguishing feature of the tool is that embedded binary content (e.g.,
base64-encoded) is detected and decoded.  The decoded content is then
recursively processed (see section [[#binary-artefacts]]).

*IMPORTANT*: This software is a work-in-progress, and is expected to change.
Make sure you consult the documentation that corresponds to the version of
~pastelyzer~ you're using.

* Running ~pastelyzer~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: running-pastelyzer
:END:

~pastelyzer~ can be run in two modes:

- interactively as an ordinary command-line utility, and
- as a background service with no user interaction.

Both of these modes are described in the following sections.

** Interesting artefacts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: interesting-artefacts
:END:

In order to keep the amount of information presented to the user manageable
not all discovered artefacts are shown.  For example not all groups of four
numbers separated with periods are IP addresses — more commonly than not the
numbers are actually version numbers.  To make the IP address extraction
useful there is an option to only show the IP addresses that fall into
specific networks (see section [[#common-cli-options][~--networks-file~
option]]).  In this case we say that the IP addresses that belong to the
specified networks are "interesting."  Similarly for top-level domains and
bank cards.

There are still some cases hard-coded in the system.  The intention is to make
the configuration facility flexible enough so that these can be removed from
the code and into the configuration.

** Common command-line options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: common-cli-options
:END:

The following options affect artefact extraction and apply in both CLI and
standalone mode:

- ~-h, --help~ ::
  Show short usage information.

- ~-v, --version~ ::
  Show version.

- ~--networks-file~ ::
  Path to a file that contains networks (in
  [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632#section-3.1][CIDR notation]]), one per
  line.  Empty lines and lines starting with a ~#~ character are ignored.  See
  https://nic.lv/local.net for an example of such a file.

- ~--[no-]resolve-damains~ ::
  If ~--resolve-domains~ option is present, domain names are resolved to IP
  addresses.  If ~--no-resolve-domains~ is present, domains are not resolved.
  If this option is not provided, domain resolution is automatically enabled
  if ~--networks-file~ is provided and loaded.

- ~--tlds-file~ ::
  Path to a file containing valid Top Level Domains (e.g.,
  https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt).  Empty lines and lines
  starting with ~#~ character are ignored.  Used to reduce the number of false
  positives.

- ~--interesting-tlds~ ::
  A comma-separated list of TLDs that should be considered interesting.  These
  are used by comparing the domains from the end, so the period should be
  included to compare the complete TLD.  Example: ~.abc,.xyz~.

- ~--important-cc-bins~ ::
  Path to a file containing important bank card
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number][BINs]].  The format of
  the file is described [[#important-cc-bins-file][below]].

*** Important bank card BINs file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: important-cc-bins-file
:END:

Each line of the file can be one of the following:

- A comment line, starting with a ~#~ character.  There can be multiple
  consecutive comment lines.  The last comment line preceding a BIN
  specification is used as a note for that BIN.
- An empty line, clears the note.
- A BIN specification.  The format is: digit characters followed by number
  placeholder characters.  The number of digit and placeholder characters
  should match the number of bank card digits corresponding to the bin (e.g.,
  16 for Visa and Mastercard).  Spaces are ignored (in both prefix and
  placeholder parts).

The following example file defines 5 bins for 2 banks.  The first bank uses
16-digit numbers that start with ~123456~, ~424242~ and ~111122~.  The second
bank uses 15-digit numbers that start with ~23~ and ~32~.

#+CAPTION: Sample important BIN file
#+NAME: sample-bin-file
#+begin_src text
  # This is just an example.

  # National bank
  1234 56xx xxxx xxxx
  424242 xx xxxx xxxx
  111122xxxxxxxxxx

  # Other bank
  23xx xxxxxx xxxxx
  32xxxxxxxxxxxxx
#+end_src

** Interactive mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: interactive-mode
:END:

The simplest way to use ~pastelyzer~ is to pass it one or more file names.
~pastelyzer~ will analyze given files and print all detected artefacts in a
tree structure (see figure [[cli-usage-sample][below]]).

#+CAPTION: Sample CLI usage
#+NAME: cli-usage-sample
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.95\textwidth :float nil
[[file:img/cli-33E400e1.png]]

Currently in this mode it is only possible to view what and where ~pastelyzer~
can detect.  In the future it will be possible to control what is extracted
(i.e., limit output to a subset of "interesting" artefact classes) and what to
do with the results (i.e,. write to a file, or generate JSON).

** Standalone mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: standalone-mode
:END:

In standalone mode ~pastelyzer~ receives documents from a feed[fn:1], stores
them in database and analyzes them.  It is possible to control what to do with
the discovered artefacts using [[#configuration][configuration]].  A sample
systemd service file is provided in
[[file:../support/pastelyzer.service][support/pastelyzer.service]] file.

*** Prerequisites
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: prerequisites
:END:

~pastelyzer~ stores all received documents in a PostgreSQL (version *9.5* or
later) database.  The database schema is provided in the source distribution
[[file:../support/schema.sql][support/schema.sql]] file.

*** Options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: standalone-options
:END:

- ~-c, --config~ ::
  Path to configuration file (see section [[#configuration]]).

- ~-w, --workers~ ::
  Number of threads to use for document processing (default: ~4~).

- ~--server-port~ ::
  Port number where to expose the built-in web server.  If the port is not
  given then the web server is not started and it will not be possible to
  interact with the application using HTTP protocol.

- ~--server-ext-host~, ~--server-ext-port~ ::
  Web server host and port to use when generating links to documents in
  emails.  If not specified, links of the form ~http://localhost/...~ will be
  generated.

- ~--[no-]process-broken~ ::
  Process pastes with broken UTF-8 content[fn:2] (in addition to trying to fix
  them; defaults to yes).  Specific sites can be blacklisted using an
  environment variable (see [[#environment-variables][~IGNORED_PASTESITES~]]).

*** Environment variables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: environment-variables
:END:

- ~DB_NAME~ ::
  Database name.  Default: ~pastelyzer~.

- ~DB_USER~ ::
  Database user.  Default: ~pastelyzer~.

- ~DB_PASS~ ::
  Database password.  Default: empty.

- ~DB_HOST~ ::
  Database host.  Default: ~localhost~.

- ~DB_PORT~ ::
  Database port.  Default: ~5432~.

- ~CIRCL_ZMQ_ADDRESS~ ::
  Paste feed endpoint[fn:3].  Default: ~tcp://crf.circl.lu:5556~.

- ~IGNORED_PASTESITES~ ::
  Comma-separated list of paste sites to not re-fetch broken pastes from.  It
  is a good idea to have at least ~pastebin.com~ in this list.

- ~HTTP_USER_AGENT~ ::
  User agent to use when fetching web pages.  This will be used verbatim as
  the HTTP ~User-Agent~ header value.

*** Static web server files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: static-web-server-files
:END:

The ~public~ directory in the source distribution is expected to be located in
the same directory where the ~pastelyzer~ binary is run from.

*** Submitting documents
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: submitting-documents
:END:

If the web server is started (see [[#standalone-options][~--server-port~]]
option) it is also possible to submit documents using HTTP POST requests.  The
following POST parameters are expected:

- ~data~ ::
  Required.  The document content.
- ~source~ ::
  Optional.  String used to identify document source.  ~store~ is used if not
  provided.  This is used as the value for ~provider~ column in the ~pastes~
  table.
- ~id~ ::
  Optional.  Identifier of the document.  If not provided the file name from
  the post data is used.  This is used as the value for ~provider_id~ column
  in the ~pastes~ table.

Example:

#+begin_example
  curl 'http://localhost:8080/store' -F data=@/path/to/a/file
#+end_example

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: configuration
:END:

Currently configuration file is used only when running in
[[#standalone-mode][standalone mode]].  By default received documents are
stored in the database, processed, and the summary of findings (what kind of
artefacts and how many) also stored in the database.  [[#sinks][Sinks]] are
additional destinations where artefacts can be collected, and
[[#filters][filters]] are used to control what artefacts end up in which
sinks.

Current sink and filter implementation is good enough to support basic use
cases.  The implementation is expected to change in the future to accommodate
additional use cases.

** Syntax overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: syntax-overview
:END:

Configuration is written using
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression][S-expressions]].  The most
unusual thing about this notation might be the prefix notation, but it can
also be thought of as XML simplified (i.e., no need for closing tags).  Please
refer to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression][Wikipedia page]] for a
more verbose introduction.

Syntax used in ~pastelyzer~ configuration file have an extension: square
brackets can be used to specify byte-vectors.  The elements between opening
and closing square brackets are expected to be space-separated hexadecimal
8-bit numbers (case-insensitive).  Example: ~[7f 45 4c 46]~.

Currently there are two recognized configuration directives (described in
following sections): ~define-sink~ and ~define-artefact-filter~.  The word
~define~ in both of them is there to let text editors that have support for
lisp-like languages recognize and treat these expressions specially (i.e., for
syntax highlighting and automatic indentation).

** Sinks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sinks
:END:

~define-sink~ directive is used to define a sink.  The syntax is as follows:

#+begin_src sexpr
  (define-sink <name> (<parent>) <attribute>*)
#+end_src

~<name>~ is the name of sink being defined and will be used to refer to it in
[[#filters][filters]] or as a parent in another sink.

~<parent>~ should be either one of the built-in sink implementations
(described in the following sections), or another thing that has been defined
previously.  Even though a sink can only have one parent it has to be
specified as a single-element list (i.e., it has to be surrounded by
parenthesis).

There can be zero or more ~<attribute>~ specifications of the following form:

#+begin_src sexpr
  (<name> <parameter>*)
#+end_src

Attribute ~<name>~ will usually be a keyword (i.e., a symbol starting with a
colon).  Each sink implementation has a different set of supported attributes
described in corresponding section below.

*** Specifying values
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: specifying-values
:END:

Attribute values have types.  This means that if a ~string~ value is required,
the value must be enclosed in double quotes (i.e., ~"this is a string"~).

Values can also be forms:

- ~<string>~ ::
  A string value stands for itself.

- ~yes~, ~true~ ::
  A boolean true value.

- ~no~, ~false~ ::
  A boolean false value.

- ~(env <string>)~ ::
  Returns the value of process environment variable named by given string.

- ~(file-contents <string>)~ ::
  Returns the contents of a file named by the given string.

- ~(or <form>+)~ ::
  Returns the first form from the given list that has a value.  For example,
  the form ~(or (env "SOME_VAR" "undefined"))~ will return
  the value of ~SOME_VAR~ environment variable, or the string ~"undefined"~ if
  there is no such environment variable.

*** Templates
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: templates
:END:

If an attribute is specified to be a template, the value of an attribute will
be generated using forms provided in the attribute.

- ~:nl~ ::
  New line: outputs a newline character, unconditionally.

- ~:fl~ ::
  Fresh line: outputs a newline only if the last character was not a newline.

- ~(extract <field>)~ ::
  Extracts ~field~ from the context variable.  See
  [[#sink-field-extractors][sink]] and [[#item-field-extractors][item]] field
  extractors below.

- ~(fmt <format-string> <form>+)~ ::
  Formats given parameters using Common-lisp
  [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_format.htm][format]]
  function.  For advanced users only.

- ~(unique-count <artefact-class>)~ ::
  Not really a filter function or an extractor, but can be used in sink
  attribute [[#templates][templates]] to calculate the number unique artefacts
  of the given ~artefact-class~ in a document currently being processed.
  Note: this is a hack, and most probably will change once we come up with a
  more general way to access this information.

**** Sink (document) level field extractors:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sink-field-extractors
:END:

- ~source-url~ ::
  Source site of the document being processed.  E.g., ~pastebin.com~.

- ~remote-url~ ::
  The URL of the document being processed (if available).

- ~remote-raw-url~ ::
  The URL to the raw contents of the document being processed (if available).

- ~local-url~ ::
  The URL to the local copy of the document being processed.  See
  ~--server-ext-host~ and ~--server-ext-port~ command line
  [[#standalone-options][options]].

- ~artefact-descriptions~ ::
  Generates a summary of all artefacts collected in a sink, grouped by
  artefact class, one per line.

- ~artefact-summary-by-class~ ::
  Generates a comma-separated string with artefact class and the number of
  artefacts with this class collected in the sink.

**** Item (artefact) level field extractors:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: item-field-extractors
:END:

- ~digits~ ::
  The digits of a bank card number with no separators.

- ~note~ ::
  Note associated with an artefact.  For
  [[#IMPORTANT-CARD-NUMBER][~important-card-number~]] it is the comment
  associated with the BIN.  See ~--important-cc-bins~
  [[#common-cli-options][option]].

*** ~WEB-SINK~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: WEB-SINK
:END:

This is the simplest sink.  It does not have any parameters.

Example:

#+begin_src sexpr
  (define-sink dashboard (web-sink))
#+end_src

*** ~SMTP-SINK~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: SMTP-SINK
:END:

This sink is used to send emails.  Attributes:

- ~(:server <string>)~ ::
  Sets the outgoing SMTP server to the given string.

- ~(:from <string>)~ ::
  Sets the sender ("From" field) of the outgoing emails.

- ~(:subject <form>+)~ ::
  [[#templates][Template]] attribute to generate subject line of the outgoing
  email.

- ~(:body <form>+)~ ::
  [[#templates][Template]] attribute to generate the body of the outgoing
  email.

- ~(:recipients <string>+)~ ::
  A list of strings, each being an email address to send the email to.

*** ~MISP-SINK~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: MISP-SINK
:END:

  Sets the MISP instance URL.

- ~(:api-key <string>)~ ::
  The API key to use when communicating with the instance.

- ~(:ca-cert <string>)~ ::
  Path to a custom CA certificate.

- ~(:user-cert <string>)~ ::
  Path to PEM-encoded user certificate.

- ~(:user-key <string>)~ ::
  Path to PEM encoded private key matching the certificate given in
  ~:user-cert~ attribute.

- ~(:user-key-pass <string>)~ ::
  Passphrase to use to decrypt the private key specified with ~:user-key~
  attribute.

- ~(:alert <boolean>)~ ::
  [[#specifying-values][Boolean]] value specifying whether this MISP event is
  or is not an alert.

- ~(:publish <boolean>)~ ::
  [[#specifying-values][Boolean]] value specifying whether to automatically
  publish this event.

- ~(:title <form>+)~ ::
  [[#templates][Template]] attribute to generate the title of MISP event.

- ~(:sharing-group <string>)~ ::
  Currently the only sharing option is a sharing group.  Given value should be
  the name of the sharing group to use (the ID will be automatically looked up
  using the API).

- ~(:document-action <form>)~ ::
  An action to perform once the MISP event is created.  Currently the
  following actions are supported:

  - ~(add-tags <string>+)~ ::
    Tag the event with the given tags.

  - ~(add-attribute :category <string> :type <string> :value <string> :comment <string>)~ ::
    Add an attribute to the event with the given ~category~, ~type~, ~value~
    and ~comment~ (optional).  The subject of the action is sink (document).

- ~(:item-action <form>)~ ::
  An action to perform after the MISP event is created, and all document
  actions are performed.  Each item action is performed once for every
  artefact collected in the sink.  The only supported action is
  ~add-attribute~:

  - ~(add-attribute :category <string> :type <string> :value <string> :comment <string>)~ ::
    Add an attribute to the event with the given ~category~, ~type~, ~value~
    and ~comment~ (optional).  The subject (context) of the action is an
    artefact.

** Filters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: filters
:END:

~define-artefact-filter~ directive is used to define a filter.  The syntax is
as follows:

#+begin_src sexpr
  (define-artefact-filter <name> <filter-expression> <action>+)
#+end_src

~<name>~ is the name of the filter.  Generally unimportant, but useful for
debugging.  Whenever an artefact is detected, ~<filter-expression>~ of every
filter is executed.  If the result is true (i.e., the filter matches), all
~<action>~ items are executed in order.  Currently the only supported action
is to collect the artefact into a sink.

Actions have the following syntax: ~(collect-into <sink-name>)~.

Filter expressions have an implicit argument: an artefact.  The following
filter expressions are supported:

- ~(type? <class>)~ ::
  True if the artefact is of the given class.  See section
  [[#artefact-classes][Artefact classes]].

- ~(and <filter-expression>+)~ ::
  True if all enclosed filter expressions are true, false otherwise.

- ~(or <filter-expression>+)~ ::
  True if any of the enclosed filter expressions is true, false otherwise.

- ~(not <filter-expression>)~ ::
  False if the given filter expression is true, false otherwise.

- ~(extract <field>)~ ::
  Extract given field from the current context value, usually an artefact.
  Extractors applicable to particular artefacts are documented in the
  corresponding [[#artefact-classes][artefact class]] section.

- ~(-> <filter-expression>+)~ ::
  Replaces the context of each consecutive filter expression with the value of
  the previous expression.  Consider the following example:

  #+begin_src sexpr
    (and (type? embedded-binary)
         (-> (extract embedded-binary-bytes)
             (or (starts-with? [4D 5A])
                 (starts-with? [7f 45 4c 46]))))
  #+end_src

  The ~and~ expression has two enclosed filter expressions.  For it to return
  true both of them have to be true.  So if the class of the artefact is not
  [[#EMBEDDED-BINARY][~EMBEDDED-BINARY~]], the value of ~and~ will be false
  (and the second form will not even be considered).  But if the context of
  the filter is indeed an [[#EMBEDDED-BINARY][~EMBEDDED-BINARY~]] then the
  value of ~and~ will be the value of second form: ~->~.

  First it calls ~(extract embedded-binary-bytes)~ (see below), and replaces
  the current context with returned value.  The next form is ~or~, and for
  this form the context is the binary bytes of the current artefact (which we
  know is an [[#EMBEDDED-BINARY][~EMBEDDED-BINARY~]]).  The forms enclosed in
  ~or~ are executed in order; if any of them returns true the value of the
  ~or~ form is also true.  In any case, the value of ~->~ form will be the
  value of the ~or~ form applied to the byte content of the
  [[#EMBEDDED-BINARY][~EMBEDDED-BINARY~]] artefact.

- ~(length)~ ::
  Returns the length of current context value.

- ~(= <number>)~ ::
  True if the current context value is equal to the given number.

- ~(< <number>)~ ::
  True if the current context value is less than the given number.

- ~(> <number>)~ ::
  True if the current context value is greater than the given number.

- ~(starts-with? <subsequence>)~ ::
  True if the context value is a sequence that starts with the given
  subsequence.

- ~(ends-with? <subsequence>)~ ::
  True if the context value is a sequence that ends with the given
  subsequence.

- ~(contains? <subsequence>)~ ::
  True if the context value is a sequence that contains the given subsequence.

** Binary artefacts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: binary-artefacts
:END:

~BINARY-ARTEFACT~ is the superclass for artefacts that are represented as
binary data (i.e. sequence of 8-bit bytes).  If the input data is not known to
be text then it is processed as binary data.  In most cases this means that
the data will be detected as being text in UTF-8 encoding and processed as
text.

*** ~COMPRESSED-BLOB~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: COMPRESSED-BLOB
:END:

Created if the ~BINARY-ARTEFACT~ bytes can be decompressed using gzip, zlib or
deflate methods.

*** ~ENCODED-STRING~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ENCODED-STRING
:END:

Created if the ~BINARY-ARTEFACT~ bytes can be decoded as UTF-8 or UTF-16
(little- or big-endian) string.

** String artefacts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: string-artefacts
:END:

~STRING-ARTEFACT~ is the superclass of all artefacts represented as text
(i.e. most of them, described below).

*** ~BANK-CARD-NUMBER~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: BANK-CARD-NUMBER
:END:

~pastelyzer~ currently recognizes bank card numbers that correspond to the
following patterns:

#+CAPTION: Bank card number patterns
#+NAME: bank-card-patterns
| Pattern               | Description                  |
|-----------------------+------------------------------|
| ~AXXXXXXXXXXXXZ~      | 14 consecutive digits        |
| ~AXXXXXXXXXXXXXZ~     | 15 consecutive digits        |
| ~AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXZ~    | 16 consecutive digits        |
| ~AXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXZ~ | 16 digits in groups of 4     |
| ~AXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXZ~   | 15 digits in groups of 4-6-5 |

In the latter two cases the separator can be single or double space or dash.
In all cases the first digit is expected to be non-zero, and the last digit is
expected to be the checksum digit (according to
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm][Luhn algorithm]]).

These rules are very lax and are expected to generate false-positives.  This
is because the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number][BINs]]
change, and we want to avoid updating the software when they do.  In the
future we expect to allow specifying the BINs in an external file.

Applicable extractors:

- ~digits~ ::
  A string of all the bank card digits with separators removed.

*** ~IMPORTANT-CARD-NUMBER~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: IMPORTANT-CARD-NUMBER
:END:

Artefact class of [[#BANK-CARD-NUMBER][bank card number]] whose BIN (prefix)
is listed in the important bank card BIN file (see
[[#common-cli-options][~--important-cc-bins~]] option).

Applicable extractors:

- ~digits~ ::
  Inherited from [[#BANK-CARD-NUMBER][~BANK-CARD-NUMBER~]].
- ~note~ ::
  Comment associated with the bin this artefact has been matched to.  See
  section [[#important-cc-bins-file]].

*** ~CREDENTIAL~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: CREDENTIAL
:END:

An username/passphrase pair, separated by colon (~:~), semicolon (~;~),
vertical bar (~|~), comma (~,~) or tab character.  At the moment regular
expressions are used to match both.  Even though the character repertoire for
passphrases is quite generous, there are some limitations:

- Only credentials with emails (see [[#EMAIL][~EMAIL~]]) as usernames are
  detected.
- Non-ASCII characters are not matched.
- Space (and tab) characters are not matched.

We plan to improve credential extraction to work around these limitations in
the future.

*** ~DOMAIN~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: DOMAIN
:END:

Everything that looks like words separated with periods, with some additional
restrictions (documented in [[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt][RFC1035]])
and other heuristics.

We strongly suggest to provide the valid TLD file (see the
[[#common-cli-options][~--tlds-file~]] option) to filter out most false
positives.

*** ~ONION~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ONION
:END:

A pseudo-domain consisting of two parts separated by a period.  The first part
being 16 or 56 alphanumeric characters (consistency not checked), the second
being ~onion~ (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion][Wikipedia entry]]).

*** ~EMAIL~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: EMAIL
:END:

Strings of the form ~username@domain~ are recognized as emails using a
simple regular expression.  Only alphanumeric characters plus a period (~.~),
underscore (~_~), percent sign (~%~), plus (~+~) and minus (~-~) are
considered in the username part.  Period-separated sequences of alphanumeric
characters are accepted as domain part.

*** ~EMBEDDED-BINARY~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: EMBEDDED-BINARY
:END:

All embedded binary artefacts (currently [[#BASE64-BLOB][~BASE64-BLOB~]],
[[#HEX-BLOB][~HEX-BLOB~]] and [[#BINARY-BLOB][~BINARY-BLOB~]]) are
specializations of this artefact class.  The textual representation is
processed and resulting binary data is available as the ~BYTES~ field (see
section [[#filters][Filters]]).

The bytes are processed, and if it turns out they represent text or compressed
data, the corresponding [[#binary-artefacts][~BINARY-ARTEFACT~]] instance is
created.

Applicable extractors:

- ~embedded-binary-bytes~ ::
  The bytes of the artefact after decoding.  Note: this will most likely be
  renamed to just ~bytes~ in near future.

**** ~BASE64-BLOB~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: BASE64-BLOB
:END:

Base64-encoded (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64][Wikipedia]])
sequence of bytes.  Example: ~TVqQ~.

**** ~HEX-BLOB~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: HEX-BLOB
:END:

A sequence of hexadecimal digit pairs, each pair representing one 8-bit byte.
Example: ~4D5A90~.

This artefact is also created for sequences of bytes written using C-syntax
for hexadecimal numbers, separated by comma and optional white-space.
Example: ~0x4d, 0x5a, 0x90~.

**** ~BINARY-BLOB~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: BINARY-BLOB
:END:

Just ones and zeroes in groups of 8 (i.e., the total number of digits must be
a multiple of 8).  Example: ~010011010101101010010000~.

*** ~IP-ADDRESS~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: IP-ADDRESS
:END:

Artefact class for IPv4 addresses.  Only addresses that belong to one of the
"interesting networks" are considered "interesting" (see
[[#common-cli-options][~--networks-file~]] option).

*** ~IP-SERVICE~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: IP-SERVICE
:END:

A specialization of [[#IP-ADDRESS][~IP-ADDRESS~]] artefact class that is
created for IPv4 address:port combination (e.g., ~1.2.3.4:8080~).

*** ~RESOLVED-IP-ADDRESS~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: RESOLVED-IP-ADDRESS
:END:

A specialization of [[#IP-ADDRESS][~IP-ADDRESS~]] artefact class for IPv4
addresses that are obtained by resolving domain names using system resolver
(see [[#DOMAIN][~DOMAIN~]]).

*** ~M3U-ENTRY~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: M3U-ENTRY
:END:

Titles of playlist entries (lines starting with ~#EXTINF:~).

*** ~URI~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: URI
:END:

URIs matched using the syntax provided in
[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A][RFC3986, appendix A]].

*** ~WINDOWS-INTERNAL~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: WINDOWS-INTERNAL
:END:

One of the strings from the following [[windows-internals][table]]:

#+CAPTION: Low-level Windows functions
#+NAME: windows-internals
| ~CreateProcess~                 | ~NtUnmapViewOfSection~ |
| ~CreateRemoteThread~            | ~NtWriteVirtualMemory~ |
| ~DefineDynamicAssembly~         | ~PointFunctionCall~    |
| ~GetDelegateForFunctionPointer~ | ~QueueUserAPC~         |
| ~GetModuleHandle~               | ~ResumeThread~         |
| ~GetProcAddress~                | ~SetThreadContext~     |

| ~NtGetContextThread~            |                        |

# Taken out of context there is nothing wrong about these functions, but they
# might raise suspicion if encountered together with other binary artefacts
# (usually shell-code).

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Currently only CIRCL.LU AIL paste feed is supported.

[fn:2] This will not be necessary once the CIRCL.LU AIL paste feed is fixed.

[fn:3] You need to contact CIRCL.LU support to whitelist the external IP
address of the machine running ~pastelyzer~.
